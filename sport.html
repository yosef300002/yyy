            Swimming is my favorite sport. It is an enjoyable sport, as I do not feel bored while swimming. Swimming is an exercise in all parts of the body. It strengthens the various muscles of the body. And it works on the coordination of muscles as well.
            
            Swimming is also useful for regulating breathing, increasing lung efficiency, and also beneficial for the heart and blood circulation.
            
            Swimming makes us healthier and better mentally, it increases our self-confidence, and we also feel joy and happiness when we win.
